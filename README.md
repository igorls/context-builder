## Why Context Builder?

Providing broad context to Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to getting high-quality, relevant responses. This tool was built to solve one problem exceptionally well: **packaging your project's source code into a clean, LLM-friendly format with zero fuss.**

It's a command-line utility that recursively processes directories and creates comprehensive markdown documentation, optimized for AI conversations.

## Core Features

- ‚ö° **Blazing Fast & Parallel by Default:** Processes thousands of files in seconds. It uses `rayon` to leverage all available CPU cores for maximum throughput.
- üß† **Smart & Efficient File Discovery:** Built on the excellent `ignore` crate, it respects `.gitignore` rules and custom ignore patterns out-of-the-box using optimized, parallel directory traversal.
- üíæ **Memory-Efficient Streaming:** Handles massive files with ease by reading and writing line-by-line, keeping memory usage low no matter the project size.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Robust & Safe by Design:** Confirms before overwriting files and gracefully skips binary content. Built with Rust's guarantees of memory safety, it's a tool you can trust.
- üå≥ **Clear File Tree Visualization:** Generates an easy-to-read directory structure at the top of the output file so you can see the project layout at a glance.
- üîç **Powerful Filtering & Preview:** Easily include only the file extensions you need and use the instant `--preview` mode to see what will be processed before generating the full output.
- üìù **Optional Line-Numbered Code Blocks:** Add line numbers to all code blocks for easy reference with a simple `--line-numbers` flag.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Process current directory and create output.md
context-builder

# Process a specific directory
context-builder -d /path/to/project

# Specify an output file
context-builder -d /path/to/project -o documentation.md
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Filter by file extensions (e.g., only Rust and TOML files)
context-builder -f rs -f toml

# Ignore specific folders/files by name
context-builder -i target -i node_modules -i .git

# Preview mode (shows the file tree without generating output)
context-builder --preview

# Add line numbers to all code blocks
context-builder --line-numbers

# Combine multiple options for a powerful workflow
context-builder -d ./src -f rs -f toml -i tests --line-numbers -o rust_context.md
```

### Command Line Options

- `-d, --input <PATH>` - Directory path to process (default: current directory).
- `-o, --output <FILE>` - Output file path (default: `output.md`).
- `-f, --filter <EXT>` - File extensions to include (can be used multiple times).
- `-i, --ignore <NAME>` - Folder or file names to ignore (can be used multiple times).
- `--preview` - Preview mode: only show the file tree, don't generate output.
- `--line-numbers` - Add line numbers to code blocks in the output.
