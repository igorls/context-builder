# Clean Benchmark Prompt (v6)

> **Purpose**: A minimal, unbiased prompt designed to benchmark whether the context file alone
> provides sufficient information for a model to find real bugs. No prior bug history, no hints,
> no leading questions. The model reviews the code cold.
>
> **Usage**: Upload the context file as an attachment, then paste the prompt below.
> **Context file**: Generated with `context-builder -f rs,toml,sh,yml -o context.md --signatures -y`

## The Prompt

```
The attached file contains the complete source code of a Rust CLI tool. The file was generated by the tool itself.

Review this codebase. For each finding, cite the exact file and line/function. Classify severity as High, Medium, or Low.

Part 1: Bugs
Find correctness bugs, security vulnerabilities, logic errors, and dead code. For each bug:
- What is wrong
- Why it matters
- How to fix it

Part 2: Architecture
Assess the overall code quality, module structure, error handling, and test coverage. Note any design issues.

Part 3: Top 5 Improvements
Rank by impact × feasibility. For each:
- Problem (concrete user pain)
- Design (approach + files to change)
- Complexity (S/M/L)
```
